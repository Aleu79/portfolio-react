            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            üëãüèΩ Hello, I'm Damian Ag√ºero, a passionate programmer from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
            I recently finished my studies at Technical School No. 1, where I discovered my love
            for technology and programming. Now I am taking the next step in my professional path,
            studying Systems Engineering at the National Technological University (UTN), with the
            dream of building a career that combines innovation and development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            üß≥ My goal is to grow as a professional in the world of technology and programming,
            constantly learning and applying my knowledge in projects that make a difference.
            Although I am just beginning this journey, I have spent time developing practical
            skills through personal projects and exploring the most current development tools.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            üíï What excites me most about being a programmer is the possibility of solving complex
            problems and creating solutions that positively impact people. I love the creative
            process behind code and the way it can transform ideas into concrete realities.
            Additionally, I enjoy collaborating with others to add value and learn as a team.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            ‚≠êÔ∏è In short, I am a programmer in training, motivated by innovation, continuous
            learning and the desire to leave a positive mark on the world through technology.
            Feel free to explore my projects and learn more about my path!
